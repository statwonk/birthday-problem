If you're curious about the paradox, I highly suggest [this fantastic breakdown of the problem](http://www.solipsys.co.uk/new/TheBirthdayParadox.html?7511303). Bonus: it applies to hashing algorithms, too, if you're into that. Finding probabilities for three or more people [can also be solved analytically](http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/56650.html). The trick is to focus on the complement of three or more like: P(0 matches) U P(1 pair). Rather than find the solution analytically, [I simulated the probabilities](https://github.com/statwonk/birthday-problem/blob/master/simulator.R).

Birthday party on!
