<a href="https://zapier.com" target="_blank">Zapier</a> had three team member birthdays on the same day this weekend. This is an exciting occurance for any data scientist as nothing ellicits more, "what are the odds!?"-type questions than birthdays. :) That's fortunate as birthday coincidences are a cool unintuitive probability paradox --- a favorite of statistical theory professors everywhere.

It turns out **the probability of at least three matching birthdays on our 28 person team is about 27%!** Much higher than almost anyone unfamiliar with the paradox would guess.

If you're curious about the paradox, I highly suggest [this fantastic breakdown of the problem](http://www.solipsys.co.uk/new/TheBirthdayParadox.html?7511303). Bonus: it applies to hashing algorithms, too, if you're into that.

Birthday party on!
